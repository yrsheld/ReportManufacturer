# ReportManufacturer

This project is developed for working colleagues to create weekly report automatically, enabling developers to see their working progress clearly and save time on writing reports from scratch.

We normally bring up or solve issues on an internal website, and thus it records our daily progress.
Via this app, one could simply paste the URL of the internal website to the GUI, and it would automatically generate a weekly report (Word file), which contains all the issues, including the details, one have worked with in a designated period.
